# Catalog Description
Engineering Computation: Numerical methods and applications to aerospace engineering problems. May include linear algebra, curve fitting, statistics, integration, and differentiation. Students use MATLAB.


# Prerequisites
M 427K with a grade of at least C-. Previous programming experience is recommended.

# Course Objectives
To develop the student’s understanding of and ability to use computers and numerical algorithms to solve engineering problems.


## Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Should Have Before Entering This Course
A first course in MATLAB programming, Calculus, Differential Equations (co-requisite).


## Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Gain from this Course (Learning Outcomes)
Understanding of how computers can be used to simulate engineering systems, basic linear algebra, knowledge of standard numerical methods and how they are implemented for linear systems, basic nonlinear systems, and basic differential equations, all using MATLAB.


## Impact On Subsequent Courses In Curriculum
Course increases students’ familiarity with computers and computer programming and how these are used with computational methods to study engineering problems.

## Topics
For each topic, students are required to write programs implementing different methods and compare them for engineering applications. The approximate number of lectures for each topic is given in parenthesis.
1. Introduction to MATLAB (k) (6 classes)
2. Sources of Error in Computer Arithmetic and Algorithms (k) (1 class)
3. Linear Systems of Equations (7 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (2 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
5. Nonlinear Equations / Root Solving (4 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
6. Introduction to Statistics (2 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
7. Data Approximation and Interpolation (4 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
8. Numerical Integration (4 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
9. Numerical Differentiation (2 classes) (a,e,g,j,k) 
10. Solving Differential Equations (6 classes) (a,e,g,j,k)

### Professionalism Topics
Assignments will include effective written and graphical communication. All work must be the student’s original work. Collaboration with other students is allowed and encouraged, but copying of solutions is strictly forbidden. 

## Design Assignments
None.

## Laboratory Assignments 
None. 
  Computer:
All assignments will have a computational component. MATLAB will be used throughout the course. GNU Octave (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) can be used instead.
