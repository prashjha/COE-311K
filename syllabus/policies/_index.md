## Grading
Homework: 35% (Each assignment might not be weighted the same) 

Exams: 20% each (40%) 

Final Exam/Project: 25% 

**Note that attendance is not considered in a studentâ€™s final grade; however, regular attendance is expected.**

## Homework Policy
There will be approximately 10 homework assignments in the semester (8-12). Students will be given a minimum of a week to complete each assignment. Assignments will be due before lecture begins and must be handed to the instructor (unless alternate arrangements have been made with the instructor). Any assignment not given directly to the instructor by the student will not be accepted. Any assignment not turned in before lecture begins will be considered late. Assignments can be turned in up to 4 days late with a loss of an additional 20% for each day the assignment is late. No exceptions to the homework policy will be made without prior instructor approval. 

Students are expected to complete their assignments independently. Students are encouraged to discuss general class topics amongst themselves; however, any sharing of code or plagiarism will be considered an act of academic dishonesty and will be dealt with severely under the Code of Conduct of the university. In addition, it is expected that students make an effort to produce organized and professional looking assignments.

## Examinations
The class will consist of two in-class exams and a final exam according to the schedule given previously. The in-class exams will cover the topics immediately preceding the exam. The final exam will focus on the topics covered since the last exam but will also have a cumulative component. If you have a conflict with any of the in-class exams, you must notify the instructor immediately.  Examinations will cover material discussed in class and homework.

## Attendance
Regular attendance is expected. Students are responsible for information covered in class.

## Office Hours
Office hours will be listed after considering the best time for students. Additionally, appointments can be made with the instructor via e-mail.

## Important Dates
Aug 25: Classes begin. 

## Special Notes 
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TDD or the College of Engineering Director of Students with Disabilities at 471-4321.

## Evaluation
Note that the Measurement and Evaluation Center forms for the Cockrell School of Engineering will be used during the last week of class to evaluate the course and the instructor. You may also want to note any other methods of evaluation you plan to employ.
