# Assignments
- There will be total 6 assignments, however, in the end we will only consider best 4 out of 6
- Assignment will be due in a week from the day it is assigned
- Upto 4 days of delay is allowed, however, each passing day you will lose 20% of the marks
- It is possible to allow late submission. You need to explain why you want to submit late and only if the instructor has confirmed, you can submit assignment late. Instructor retains the rights to decide in this matter
- In case you are going through emergency, do not worry about the late submission. You can submit assignment once you are out of the emergency. Of course, late submission in this case will only be accepted if the reasons you have provided are valid. Instructor retains the rights to decide in this matter
- Assignments have to completed without any collaboration or help. There will be penalty if we find signs of plagiarism 
- Codes developed to complete the assignments should also be independent and graders will check if there is plagiarism or code is copied from online sources
- Instead of engaging in such activities, you are encouraged to get help from TAs and instructor and complete the assignments independently

# Projects/exams
In order to encourage collaboration and exchange of ideas, we will assign two projects during the semester. Some points:

- projects are more challenging than the assignments
- we will form the group of 5 students and each group will complete the project
- members within group will work together to complete the project, however,
- the final reports that you will submit has to be prepared individually
- you will get about 2-3 weeks of time (depending on the complexity) to complete the project

Regarding late submissions, we will follow the rules of `Assignments` section above.

# Final project/exam
Depending on the performance of class, you will either get a project as a final exam or in-class exam. More details will be available at later times.

# Important remarks
1. Depending on the performance of class, we may or may not have a mid-term exam. You will of course be made aware at least 2-3 weeks ahead of time.
2. I reserve the right to give a Q or F grade, or otherwise terminate, a studentâ€™s class registration for any reason that I believe to be disruptive to the learning process of the student or of the class.
