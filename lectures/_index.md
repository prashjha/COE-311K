# Lectures
Lectures, hopefully, will be face-to-face. However, to allow students make the most of the course, I will also prepare online lecture videos that will be uploaded to youtube.

The lectures will be mix of presentation slides and notes. For each lecture, the pdf and ppt files will be made available at github repository.

Further, lecture slides and notes, the assignments, and tutorial examples will be hosted on github. 

## Browsing the lectures
Left side of the page, you can see the **Lecture** menu. Below this menu, all the lectures presently available will be shown. You can click on different lectures for more details.
