# Lectures
Lectures, hopefully, will be face-to-face. Since we will do some coding and also little bit of theory, the lectures will be delivered with a mix of presentation and handwritten notes. The notes and slides will be available in the github repository of this course.

On the right-side of website, you can find the list of lectures. The list will be updated as we move further in the course.
